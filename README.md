ABSTRACT

This project visualizes population data for South Indian states from 2010 to 2025 using multiple types of plots. The data is sourced from a CSV file containing annual population figures for Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. The visualizations include a bar chart showing the population of these states in 2020, a histogram displaying the distribution of populations in 2020, a line graph illustrating population trends over the years, and a pie chart representing the population distribution among the states in 2020. These visualizations offer insights into regional population dynamics and trends, aiding in comparative and trend analysis.

INTRODUCTION

population data is crucial for understanding demographic trends and making informed decisions in areas such as resource allocation, urban planning, and policy development. this project focuses on the population trends of five south indian states—tamil nadu, karnataka, kerala, andhra pradesh, and telangana—over a period from 2010 to 2025. by utilizing a csv dataset containing yearly population figures, this project employs various data visualization techniques to present the data comprehensively. To visualize the population data, the python library matplotlib is used. matplotlib is a popular library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in python. to install matplotlib, follow these steps: Install matplotlib: run the following command to install matplotlib using pip: pip install matplotlib

CONCLUSION

This project effectively utilizes matplotlib to create a range of visualizations that provide insights into the population trends and distributions among south indian states. The bar chart, histogram, line graph, and pie chart each offer a different perspective on the data, making it easier to analyze and interpret demographic trends. By employing these visualizations, we gain a comprehensive understanding of regional population dynamics, which is valuable for various analytical and decision-making purposes.
